<h2>HYMEN</h2>


<p><i>As from a temple service, tall and dignified, with slow pace, each a
queen, the sixteen matrons from the temple of Hera pass before the
curtain&mdash;a dark purple hung between Ionic columns&mdash;of the porch or
open hall of a palace. Their hair is bound as the marble hair of the
temple Hera. Each wears a crown or diadem of gold.</i></p>

<p><i>They sing&mdash;the music is temple music, deep, simple, chanting
notes:</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the closed garden<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where our feet pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back and forth each day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This gladiolus white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This red, this purple spray&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gladiolus tall with dignity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As yours, lady&mdash;we lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before your feet and pray:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of all the blessings&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youth, joy, ecstasy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May one gift last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As the tall gladiolus may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outlast the wind-flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winter-rose or rose),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One gift above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encompassing all those;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For her, for him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all within these palace walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the cry of Hymen and the torch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the night and music<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoing through the porch till day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><i>The music, with its deep chanting notes, dies away. The curtain
hangs motionless in rich, full folds. Then from this background of
darkness, dignity and solemn repose, a flute gradually detaches itself,
becomes clearer and clearer, pipes alone one shrill, simple little melody.</i></p>

<p><i>From the distance, four children's voices blend with the flute, and
four very little girls pass singly before the curtain, small maids or
attendants of the sixteen matrons. Their hair is short and curls at the
back of their heads like the hair of the chryselephantine Hermes. They
sing:</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where the first crocus buds unfold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We found these petals near the cold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Swift river-bed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beneath the rocks where ivy-frond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Puts forth new leaves to gleam beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Those lately dead:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The very smallest two or three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gold (gold pale as ivory)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We gather&egrave;d.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>When the little girls have passed before the curtain, a wood-wind
weaves a richer note into the flute melody; then the two blend into one
song. But as the wood-wind grows in mellowness and richness, the
flute gradually dies away into a secondary theme and the wood-wind
alone evolves the melody of a new song.</i></p>

<p><i>Two by two&mdash;like two sets of medallions with twin profiles distinct,
one head slightly higher, bent forward a little&mdash;the four figures of four
slight, rather fragile taller children, are outlined with sharp white
contour against the curtain.</i></p>

<p><i>The hair is smooth against the heads, falling to the shoulders but
slightly waved against the nape of the neck. They are looking down,
each at a spray of winter-rose. The tunics fall to the knees in sharp
marble folds. They sing:</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Never more will the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cherish you again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never more will the rain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Never more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we find you bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the snow and wind.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The snow is melted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snow is gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you are flown:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like a bird out of our hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a light out of our heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are gone.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>As the wistful notes of the wood-wind gradually die away, there
comes a sudden, shrill, swift piping.</i></p>

<p><i>Free and wild, like the wood-maidens of Artemis, is this last group of
four&mdash;very straight with heads tossed back. They sing in rich, free,
swift notes. They move swiftly before the curtain in contrast to the
slow, important pace of the first two groups. Their hair is loose and
rayed out like that of the sun-god. They are boyish in shape and
gesture. They carry hyacinths in baskets, strapped like quivers to their
backs. They reach to draw the flower sprays from the baskets, as the
Huntress her arrows.</i></p>

<p><i>As they dart swiftly to and fro before the curtain, they are youth,
they are spring&mdash;they are the Chelidonia, their song is the swallow-song
of joy:</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Between the hollows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the little hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spring spills blue&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turquoise, sapphire, lapis-lazuli<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a brown cloth outspread.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How carefully we lay them now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each hyacinth spray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the marble floor&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pattern your bent eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May trace and follow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the shut bridal door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lady, our love, our dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our bride most fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They grew among the hollows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the hills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the sea had spilled its blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the sea had risen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From its bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sinking to the level of the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left hyacinths on the floor.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></div></div>

<p><i>There is a pause. Flute, pipe and wood-wind blend in a full, rich
movement. There is no definite melody but full, powerful rhythm like
soft but steady wind above forest trees. Into this, like rain, gradually
creeps the note of strings.</i></p>

<p><i>As the strings grow stronger and finally dominate the whole, the
bride-chorus passes before the curtain. There may be any number in
this chorus. The figures&mdash;tall young women, clothed in long white
tunics&mdash;follow one another closely, yet are all distinct like a procession
of a temple frieze.</i></p>

<p><i>The bride in the center is not at first distinguishable from her maidens;
but as they begin their song, the maidens draw apart into two groups,
leaving the veiled symbolic figure standing alone in the center.</i></p>

<p><i>The two groups range themselves to right and left like officiating
priestesses. The veiled figure stands with her back against the curtain,
the others being in profile. Her head is swathed in folds of diaphanous
white, through which the features are visible, like the veiled Tanagra.</i></p>

<p><i>When the song is finished, the group to the bride's left turns about;
also the bride, so that all face in one direction. In processional form they
pass out, the figure of the bride again merging, not distinguishable from
the maidens.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But of her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We can say that she is fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we know underneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the wanness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(In her blanched face)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the dark center leaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the white Syrian iris.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The rather hard, hieratic precision of the music&mdash;its stately pause
and beat&mdash;is broken now into irregular lilt and rhythm of strings.</i></p>

<p><i>Four tall young women, very young matrons, enter in a group. They
stand clear and fair, but this little group entirely lacks the austere precision
of the procession of maidens just preceding them. They pause in
the center of the stage; turn, one three-quarter, two in profile and the
fourth full face; they stand, turned as if confiding in each other like a
Tanagra group.</i></p>

<p><i>They sing lightly, their flower trays under their arms.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Along the yellow sand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is bright and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the bronze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shining bark and wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run the fine threads of gold.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here in our wicker-trays,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of fragrant bays:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lady, their blushes shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As faint in hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when through petals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a laurel-rose<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(Ah, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So her fair breasts will shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the faint shadow above.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The harp chords become again more regular in simple definite
rhythm. The music is not so intense as the bride-chorus; and quieter,
more sedate, than the notes preceding the entrance of the last group.</i></p>

<p><i>Five or six slightly older serene young women enter in processional
form; each holding before her, with precise bending of arms, coverlets
and linen, carefully folded, as if for the bride couch. The garments are
purple, scarlet and deep blue, with edge of gold.</i></p>

<p><i>They sing to blending of wood-wind and harp.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From citron-bower be her bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut from branch of tree a-flower,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That all the wood in blossoming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May calm her heart and cool her blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For losing of her maidenhood.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The wood-winds become more rich and resonant. A tall youth crosses
the stage as if seeking the bride door. The music becomes very rich, full
of color.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The figure itself is a flame, an exaggerated symbol; the hair a flame;
the wings, deep red or purple, stand out against the curtains in a contrasting
or almost clashing shade of purple. The tunic, again a rich
purple or crimson, falls almost to the knees. The knees are bare; the
sandals elaborately strapped over and over. The curtain seems a
rich purple cloud, the figure, still brighter, like a flamboyant bird, half
emerged in the sunset.</i></p>

<p><i>Love pauses just outside the bride's door with his gift, a tuft of black-purple
cyclamen. He sings to the accompaniment of wood-winds, in a
rich, resonant voice:</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The crimson cover of her bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not so rich, nor so deeply bled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The purple-fish that dyed it red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when in a hot sheltered glen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There flowered these stalks of cyclamen:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(Purple with honey-points<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of horns for petals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet and dark and crisp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fragrant as her maiden kiss.)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There with his honey-seeking lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bee clings close and warmly sips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeks with honey-thighs to sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drink the very flower away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(Ah, stern the petals drawing back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah rare, ah virginal her breath!)<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Crimson, with honey-seeking lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun lies hot across his back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gold is decked across his wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quivering he sways and quivering clings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Ah, rare her shoulders drawing back!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One moment, then the plunderer slips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the purple flower-lips.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Love passes out with a crash of cymbals. There is a momentary pause
and the music falls into its calm, wave-like rhythm.</i></p>

<p><i>A band of boys passes before the curtain. They pass from side to side,
crossing and re-crossing; but their figures never confuse one another, the

symbolic gesture, stooping as if to gather up the wreaths, or swaying with
long stiff branch as if to sweep the fallen petals from the floor.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>There is no marked melody from the instruments, but the boys' voices,
humming lightly as they enter, gradually evolve a little dance song.
There are no words but the lilt up and down of the boys' tenor voices.</i></p>

<p><i>Then, as if they had finished the task of gathering up the wreaths and
sweeping the petals, they stand in groups of two before the pillars where
the torches have been placed. They lift the torches from the brackets.
They hold them aloft between them, one torch to each two boys. Their
figures are cut against the curtain like the simple, triangular design on
the base of a vase or frieze&mdash;the boys' heads on a level, the torches above
them.</i></p>

<p><i>They sing in clear, half-subdued voices.</i></p>

<p><i>At the end of the song, the torches flicker out and the figures are no

chords.</i></p>
